       <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        
       <p>  The best way, I believe to begin any origin story is right at the beginning.  I was born on a bright sun struck day in April 1983, the 30<sup>th</sup> to be exact.  My Mother was as proud as any would imagine.  Assuming my childhood to quite irrelevant for the exercise I move right on to the thick of things.  After high school I decided it was time to take flight.  I booked a one way ticket to Brisbane.  Imagining a seamless introduction to a new life free of the stress and struggle of learning a new language, for now.  I lived in Australia for mere months before I found myself rather tired and mulled over by a life of Canadian similarities.  It was during this same time I met a young, taut Swede of Danish decent, she was to show me a new life of adventure and excitement.  The following day, after talking only briefly of our grandiose plans of departure, that we booked flights from Sydney to Bangkok.  Our new foreign lives waited for us in the northern jungles of the Thai people.  We will leave the story there and take us to the present day as the rest would take some time to fully get into.</p>    
       <p>My Mother has recently retired and she has always been one of my closest and dearest loved ones.  To her surprise she saw her son on her doorstep smiling up at her not one year ago.  I have decided it was time to come home and be close to old friends and new babies.  It has been sometime since I have delved into any scholarly deeds and I believe any stint in academia is always a grand idea and a wonderful time.  I last attended an institution in Burnaby in 2009.  I have always loved learning and I believe it takes a lot of love to make things work out.  I am ever so excited to be a part of the Interactive Media Design program here at Algonquin.   </p>
